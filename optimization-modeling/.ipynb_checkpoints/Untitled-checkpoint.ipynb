    "UW-Madison's campus press needs to distribute university newspapers (e.g. the Daily Cardinal) to major locations on campus. The circulation office can be built at university libraries for printing and delivering newspapers. To save limited budget, the press decides to find an economical way to do so. Specifically, we need to decide the locations of circulation offices and where to deliver for each of the office.\n",
